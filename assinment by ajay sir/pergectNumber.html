<!-- 
You are developing a Fitness Tracker App that awards bonus points to users based on their total number of steps taken in a day. To make the rewards more fun and rare, the app gives a special "Perfect Day" badge to users whose step count is a perfect number.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).
For example, 28 is a perfect number because its proper divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14) sum up to 28.

Your task is to:

Write a program to check if a user's step count qualifies as a perfect number.

Display an appropriate message like:

 "Perfect Day! You’ve earned the badge!" if the number is perfect.

 "Not a perfect day, but keep going!" otherwise.

Input: Total number of steps taken (positive integer)
