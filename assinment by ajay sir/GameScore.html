<!-- 
You're building GameScore, a tool to help gamers track their scores across different levels of a game. 
Users can add scores, remove them, calculate totals, apply bonuses, and compare scores—all using JavaScript
 functions.

Implement each feature using the specified function types and concepts.

1. Add Level Score
Write a function declaration named addScore(scores, newScore) that adds a new level score to the array and
returns the updated score list.

2. Remove Specific Score
Write a function expression named removeScore(scores, scoreToRemove) that removes a specific score (if found) 
and returns the updated array.

3. Check if High Score
Define an arrow function isHighScore(score) that checks if a score is greater than or equal to a given 
threshold (e.g., 80).

4. Calculate Total Score
Create a function calculateTotalScore(scores) that returns the total sum of all scores in the array.

5. Apply Bonus to Each Score
Write a function applyBonus(scores, bonus = 5) that adds bonus points to every score using map() and returns 
a new array.

6. Add Multiple Scores at Once
Use a function addMultipleScores(scores, ...newScores) with rest parameters to add any number of scores at
 once to the existing list.
