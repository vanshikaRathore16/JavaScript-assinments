<!-- 
You're developing TuneTrack, a smart music playlist manager that helps users manage their favorite tracks. 
Users can add or remove songs, check if songs are trending, calculate the total duration of songs, apply
 skip-time, and more. Implement each of the following features using appropriate JavaScript function types
  and concepts.

1. Add Song to Playlist
Write a function declaration named addToPlaylist(playlist, songName) that adds a song name (string) to 
the playlist array and returns the updated playlist.

2. Remove Song from Playlist
Use a function expression named removeFromPlaylist(playlist, songName) to remove a song by its name from 
the playlist and return the updated array.

3. Check Trending Songs
Define an arrow function isTrending(songName) that checks whether a given song is in a predefined list 
of trending songs.

4. Calculate Total Duration
Write a function calculateDuration(durations, speed = 1) that takes an array of song durations (in minutes)
 and returns the total time to listen, adjusted for playback speed (default is normal speed: 1x).

5. Add Multiple Songs
Create a function addBulkSongs(playlist, ...songs) using rest parameters to add multiple songs to the
 playlist at once and return the updated playlist.
