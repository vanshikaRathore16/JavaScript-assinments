Assignment 1: Time Converter 
An event management company is developing a scheduling system. One of the key tasks is converting the duration of events from total seconds (which their sensor system records) into a more human-readable format of hours, minutes, and seconds.

You are hired as a Java developer to create a tool that helps event coordinators quickly understand how long an event lasted.
Write a Java program that:

Accepts the total event duration in seconds as input.

Calculates how many hours, minutes, and seconds it corresponds to.

Displays the output in the format:

Hours: x, Minutes: y, Seconds: z
Sample Input:
Total event duration in seconds: 3672
Sample Output:
Hours: 1, Minutes: 1, Seconds: 12
