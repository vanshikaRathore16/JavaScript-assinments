5. A fitness app is analyzing a user’s step count over the past week. It wants to identify days with perfect step counts — where the step count is a perfect number.

Write a program that:

Accepts two numbers as input (min and max steps over the week).

Finds and displays all perfect numbers between those two values.

Output each perfect number with a message:

“Day with X steps is a Perfect Day!”
